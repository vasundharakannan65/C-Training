Delegate is a reference type data type and you can define variables of delegate, just like other data type, 
that can refer to any method with the same signature as the delegate

Steps for delegate:- 
1. Declare a delegate 
[access_modifier] delegate [return_type] [delegate_name](params); 

2.Create an obj of delegate 
[delegate_name] obj = new [delegate_name](method);
or 
[delegate_name] obj = method; 
or 
[delegate_name] obj = (param) => stmt; 

3.Invoke delegate 
delobj.Invoke();
or
del();
