File system: 

Namespace used : System.IO;
file is an ordered and named collection of bytes 
stream is a sequence of bytes that you can use to read from and write to a backing store
FileStream is a class used for reading and writing files in C#
UTF8 which is an encoding standard capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode

absolute path - begins with root directory and follow tree branches upto desired directory 
		eg: /folder_name/file_name
relative path - ref. from ur working directory upto desired directory 
		eg: /.. /.. /Documents 


File.Exists() // checks whether file exists or not 
File.Delete() //deletes the file 

//to create a file
using (FileStream fs = File.Create(..path))
{ 	
	byte[] info = new UTF8Encoding(true).GetBytes("text"); 
	fs.Write( info ); 
} 

or 

FileStream fileObj = new FileStream(file Name/Path, FileMode.field, FileAccess.field, FileShare.field); - SYNTAX  

filemode - open,create,append,truncate 
fileaccess - read,write 
fileshare - none,read,write,readwrite,delete 

//To read file 
filemode = open 
fileaccess = read 
create a byte[] array and read 

file.ReadAllText() - read the file as 1 string 
file.ReadAllLines - read each line of file into string array 

//move file src - dest 
file.move(src,dest) 

//to copy a file 
File.Copy(sourceFile, destinationFile, true);  
src,dest,true helps us to overwrite the file


We can create Directory using CreateDirectory() 
to rename/move Move(src,dest) 
to delete Directory.Delete(Dirrname,true) - first deletes all files & subdir then main directry
